NOTE: As of Android 6.0, users now grant permissions to apps while the app is running. This app requires Storage and Microphone permissions, which must be enabled through the app's Settings screen, through Settings -> Applications -> Application manager -> Stage Ready -> Permissions in order for the app to function properly. Another way to enable permissions is by long pressing on the app's icon and going to App info -> Permissions.
